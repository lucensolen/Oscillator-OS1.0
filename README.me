# Oscillation OS v1.0

A small, self-contained daily cockpit for running your **Ground ⇅ Flight** engine.

- No accounts
- No backend
- All data stored locally in `localStorage`
- Designed to be Lucen-compatible later as an integration layer

## Files

- `index.html` – main layout and structure
- `style.css` – dark glassy UI styling
- `app.js` – state engine, logging, pattern computation
- `README.md` – this file

## How to use

1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Choose your pole with the vertical slider:
   - Up = **FLIGHT** (creation, precision, builds)
   - Down = **GROUND** (body, mud, diesel, chores)
3. Rate your current energy and optionally add a short note.
4. Click **"Log Current State"**.
5. Add **Ground** and **Flight** actions to the Field Log as your day unfolds.
6. Watch:
   - Today’s Cycle
   - Last 7 Days Ground vs Flight
   - Engine Reflection
   - Momentum & Frequency labels at the top

## Local storage keys

- `oscillation.os.stateLog`
- `oscillation.os.fieldLog`

These can later be bridged into the Lucen / Nucleos memory system.

## Hosting

You can host this as static files on:

- GitHub Pages
- Cloudflare Pages

No configuration needed beyond serving the files.
